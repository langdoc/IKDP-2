# Meeting 28.6.2017
* Skype
* 12:00â€“12:30
* Micha, Rogier, Niko

## General

- Niko has been initiating cooperation with Munchen, this will lead into a small sub-corpus of phonemically aligned sentences. As they will be out of context, their distribution openly should be less problematic than with the current data.
- There is a paper Niko writes in Paris now which will probably be useful also to us.
- We discussed Niko's PhD and the current situation, we need a general plan (and also a topic)
