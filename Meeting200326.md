# Meeting 26.3.2020

## Topics

- Niko has set up the FST's and CG to work so that we can get both Komi and Russian analysis, and just take the Russian when there is no Komi reading
- Both Komi and Russian analysis go now through Komi CG
- This operation reduces the number of unknown forms from 15% to 10%
- We have run out of CSC's billing units (this is normal and expected), so Micha as CSC's project head person should apply for more billing units, this should be just one click away
    - One reason why we ran out of them was that Niko didn't know what he was doing with servers, but what can we do, that's how we learn
- Micha could also apply at the same time for us to have this [Allas](https://www.csc.fi/en/-/allas-tuo-nykyaikaisen-datanhallinnan-tutkijoiden-kayttoon) tool from CSC
    - The logic would be that our multimedia is in IDA storage, but CSC recommends now Allas for files that change often
    - I'm also collaborating bit with Oulu people, and they are setting up their system now same way
