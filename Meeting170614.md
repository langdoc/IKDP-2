- Skype
- 12:10-12:40
- Niko, Rogier, Micha

## General

- Things in Syktyvkar are in order, although we need more ways to follow what goes on
- Course Niko taught went well
- Niko is designing a new database structure with Dima, which will make cooperation easier
- There will be a workshop in Helsinki in October/December
    - There is a need to find more money for travel, partially this can be funded from our project as one workshop is planned per year, and it fits very well to our general plan
- Niko does some syntactic stuff in Paris and this can also be useful for our project in some point
