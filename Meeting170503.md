## Syntactic description in GitHub
* Rogier started drafting the syntactic description
* We discussed whether the description should be more or less variationalist descriptive and decided to leave the answer open for now, but
  * Description will not be restricted to the Izhva dialect, but include all (spoken, written, dialectal, etc.) data we have available
  * Linguistic examples in the text will not only refer to the actual corpus, but also include functional hyperlinks
  
## Status of corpus data in ELAN
* We stick to the currently used "dialectal orthographic transcription" in the ongoing transcription work for the sake of consistency.
* More normalized versions will be derived outside ELAN using rules in our preprocessing pipeline.
* There are issues in the current transcripts, which have to be fixed, e.g. white spaces before punctuation marks, inconsistencies in punctuation marks, etc.

## Tasks open  
* ALL check the possibility to arrange a working meeting with Micha, Niko, Rogier in Paris before the summer.
* MICHA prepares a new repo for FRibliography.
* MICHA makes a list of issues to fix in current ELAN files.
* NIKO prepares an example md-file (incl. linguistic examples, references, indices, etc.) for Rogier.
* NIKO learns how the Giellatekno proprocessing pipeline works and builds an additional preprocessor for orthography conversion rules.
* ROGIER writes to Marina and sends an update.
  
## Ideas
* GitHub training with Rogier (on-site, Micha)
* ELAN/TROVA teaching for Rogier (on-site, Niko)
