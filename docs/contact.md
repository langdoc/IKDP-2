The project is led by Rogier Blokland from Uppsala University, and other participants and Niko Partanen and Michael Rießler. Please contact us by following email addresses: [Rogier Blokland](mailto:rogier.blokland@moderna.uu.se), [Niko Partanen](mailto:nikotapiopartanen@gmail.com) and [Michael Rießler](mailto:michael.riessler@skandinavistik.uni-freiburg.de).

Significant collaborators in our project are [Giellatekno](http://giellatekno.uit.no/) and [The Finno-Ugric Laboratory for Support of the Electronic Representation of Regional Languages](http://fu-lab.ru) in Syktyvkar. We work within larger [langdoc-infrastructure](https://github.com/langdoc), which is a common attempt to share comparable and consistent workflows between different language documentation projects. Our work is funded by [Kone Foundation](http://www.koneensaatio.fi/en).
