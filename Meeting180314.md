## Syntactic description in GitHub

- Rogier writes phonology and morphology
- Very nice book

    - Short intoduction to the earlier studies
    - Abbr explained
- Linguistic profile part
- Phonology and morphology, in the background sense
- Micha suggests that word each inflected word class there is its own section which is only about morphology
    - Not about things like analytic verb tenses, which comes into syntax parts
    - Morphology part necessary for syntactic analysis
- Syntax part will be referring back to morphology when needed
- Form to function -approach in Mosel's terms. What is the head and what dependent constituents are possible, and these are all described from the point of view of the syntactic structure
- The last part can describe individual syntactic features from different perspective

- Discussion about publishing drafts, something will be online once the text is coherent
