# Meeting 05.10.2017
* Skype
* 15:00â€“15:30
* Micha, Niko

## General

Niko and Micha went through the current project situation, which is that some of the work related to the project is also being done in Syktyvkar. The workshop in Helsinki had gone well and it is clear from continous SVN commits that they are actively engaged to development of GT Komi tools. We will be testing the result continuously, and we also have to be monitoring the CG rules as they connect to our syntax writing.

Related to basic logistics, there is probably a need for longer meeting between the three main participants to write the draft collaborately.
