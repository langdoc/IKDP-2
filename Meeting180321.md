## General

- Writing has proceeded very well
- when adjectives and comparatives are discussed, the use of *самой* should be checked
- джык deserves more discussion, although is largely outside the current book
    - Niko collects examples of what can come after this affix
- General literature about adpositions and spatial cases should be checked
- Projects such as Grammbank provide also material for questions
- What is the role of Komi dialects in respect to written language, how often the dialectal features appear in written standard?
