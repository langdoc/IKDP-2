# Meeting 20.05.2021

- Zoom
- 14:00-15:00
- Niko, Mietta Lennes

## Notes

- Pseudonymized version of the corpus will be Korp under ACA
- Audio and video files associated with the ELAN files will be in a downloadable version which has restricted access
- University of Helsinki will be the register keeper in GDPR sense, but the copyrights or authorship remains within the project. Probably the project PI would be mentioned there.
  - This is mainly connected to who actually need to sign the contract with Kielipankki: it can be easiest if it is only Rogier, but other project members, if they have rights to the material, should have expressed in email or otherwise that they agree with this.
- Two versions will have distinct contracts (that still need to be translated into English first)
- This means that the ACA version will be accessible permanently, but for the downloadable version the permission has to go through the project's leader or representative. It can also be possible to give Kielipankki or CSC the right to process the requests themselves.
- There will be several appendices to the contract:
  - One that explains how the corpus needs to be cited
  - Information about the license (in this case it is fixed in ACA and restricted, some details can be adjusted)
  - Information about the personal and identifiable data the corpus contains
  - Explanation of why the corpus contains the personal data, a possible risk analysis
- We can have a third version in Nijmegen that contains all original multimedia etc. It is maybe the best to have it there, since Kielipankki doesn't yet do truly long term storage of the materials.
  - Contractually or legally there is no problem with having it both in Nijmegen and Helsinki, those two just aren't directly connected to each other in any way. We can, of course, ourselves have conventions through which they are connected, i.e. Kielipankki version is essentially exported from the version in Nijmegen, and matches with it.
