## General

- Niko sends tripod to Rogier
- We discussed syntactic description of	Komi
    - UD and CG, their interoperability
    - Idiosynchronies in descriptions of individual languages -- what is comparable in the end
    - Materials used in the description will be primarily about written language for now
    - Relation of spoken and written language is complex, but should be investigated only to limited degree in this point, probably the description of the written language can anyway be used as a starting point

- Niko writes a	course description and sends it to Micha
